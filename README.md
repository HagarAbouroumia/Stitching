# Stitching
The project contains 3 files and 1 image folder
  1.main.py --> were we use to run the code
  2.functions.py --> contains the required functions 
  3.Image.py --> image class

To stitch any set of images, there should be an overlap part between the 2 consecutive images in the list of images.

To test any set of images, change the variable name "folder_name" in the main.py to the address of the folder that contains the images.
